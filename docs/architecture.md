# Invoiceme Architecture

Invoiceme Portal is powered by PHP on `backend` and ReactJS on `front-end`. The stack details are mentioned below.


## Back-end

we follow clean architecture principles with decoupled architecture having separate Domain/Application/Infrastructure layer.

Also use Laravel so kind of hybrid car, handle request validation & routing etc

| Technology | Version |
| --- | ----------- |
| Laravel | 12.x |


## Front-end
We are using react.js library for the front-end, by utilizing  `vite`.


| Technology | Version |
| --- | ----------- |
| react.js | 19.* |


## PROD & DEV Environments

Both PROD and DEV environments are hosted in AWS. Both environments are sharing the same EC2 instance called `Invoiceme` under the AWS region `Singapore`.
If you want to access the server, you can connect to the `Invoiceme` instance in the `AWS console` under `EC2` services page.

The DNS records for both the invoiceme.app and invoiceme.dev are managed in the `AWS Route53`

We are using `Laravel Forge` to configure and deploy the changes to the PROD and DEV instance.
- PROD deployment is configured in a way where the changes are pulled from the `master` branch
- DEV deployment is configured in a way where the changes are pulled from the `develop` branch

The server is been configured using the `LEMP` stack
- `L` - Linux (Ubuntu 20)
- `E` - Nginx (Web server)
- `M` - Mariadb 11.* (Database)
- `P` - PHP 8.2.*
